# Simple Chess GUI and AI

I did this project a while ago, mainly for the purpose of getting some more experience and fluency coding in Python. Most of the code within this project is condensed into a few files, and focuses mainly on the game mechanics, GUI, and user interaction. The AI implemeneted here is a basic minimax algorithm, which the user can determine the depth of and play against. Depth selection is done in `move_node.py` (labeled at the top), and the game is started by running  `rungame.py`. You may need to `pip install tkinter` to run. Since the majority of my time here was spent coding the game mechanics and GUI, the AI aspect is pretty inefficient and clunky, although the concepts work fundamentally. 

I've since done a rework through a school project that focuses entirely on the artificial intelligence component of the game, which can be found in [CS76-Projects/Chess](https://github.com/brendanshaw14/CS-76-Projects/tree/main/Chess). Check out the `report.md` for a detailed description of the updates I made here.
